# DeployableGoat 

### A small subset of [TerraGoat](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat) vulnerable-by-design Terraform resources.
 
Designed to still have policy violations, but of a low-enough severity that it can be safely deployed in testing environments for training perposes without breaking the shared-responsibility security model of AWS.

For usage, see [The Bridgecrew AWS Workshop](https://bridgecrew.awsworkshop.io)
